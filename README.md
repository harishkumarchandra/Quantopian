# FinTech Case Study on Quantopian

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company is Quantopian

* It was the company incorporated 2011

* The founders of the company are John Fawcett and Jean Bredeche

* The business model capitalizes on a trend jokingly dubbed "the latest DIY craze" by the Wall Street Journal.

* Over its history, Quantopian has raised $48.8M from investors such as Spark Capital, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Point72 Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz


## Business Activities:

The company has a two-sided market business model:

The first side consists of algorithm-developer members who develop and test for free, focusing on algorithm development for factors that can be added to Quantopian's offerings to institutional investors.All members can compete against other members in a series of contests called the "Quantopian Open."Anyone can join the site and (optionally) enter the contests: no particular educational qualification nor work experience are required. Quantopian provides them with free data sources and tools, largely built in the Python programming language.

The second side is institutional investors. Serving them will become the main focus of Quantopian. These members have their investments managed by the winning algorithms. Successful developer-members can get a royalty or commission from investor-members, who profit from the former's algorithm used with larger resources > $1M. Board member Andrew Parker claims that Quantopian is aiming for modest number of users and a large average revenue per user (ARPU); more like Bloomberg than Facebook.

Previously the company provided brokerage integrations to individual investors. These integrations were continued by the community who started the open source project Zipline-Live.In 2018, the company announced the availability of an enterprise software product for asset managers, in partnership with FactSet.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* Its primary competitors are other open source trading platforms, mainly Numerai, QuantConnect, & WorldQuant.


## Results

* The company has funded individual algorithms with as much as $50,000,000. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* In February 2020 Quantopian announced it would return investors' money due to the underperformance of its investment strategies.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

#### 4. Write the case study.

Write the finished case study report in a markdown `README.md` file, using the above case study template. Your report should be sufficiently long to ensure you provide all relevant information about the company or project in a thorough manner.

Be sure to cite your sources in an addendum at the end of the report. List all websites, podcasts, blogs, or articles that you consulted in order to write the report, and provide links. Your list should be thorough and account for all sources you used, but it does not need to be a formal works cited page.


#### 5. Upload your case study to your git repository.

You learned some technical aspects of FinTech this week, including how to set up and populate a git repository. As a final step, take your finished case study and upload it to a repository to share with your instructor and class.
