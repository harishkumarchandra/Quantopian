# FinTech Case Study on Quantopian

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company is Quantopian
* It was the company incorporated 2011
* The founders of the company are John Fawcett and Jean Bredeche
* The business model capitalizes on a trend jokingly dubbed "the latest DIY craze" by the Wall Street Journal.
* Over its history, Quantopian has raised $48.8M from investors such as Spark Capital, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Point72 Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz

## Business Activities:

The company has a two-sided market business model:

- The first side consists of algorithm-developer members who develop and test for free, focusing on algorithm development for factors that can be added to Quantopian's offerings to institutional investors.All members can compete against other members in a series of contests called the "Quantopian Open."Anyone can join the site and (optionally) enter the contests: no particular educational qualification nor work experience are required. Quantopian provides them with free data sources and tools, largely built in the Python programming language.

- The second side is institutional investors. Serving them will become the main focus of Quantopian. These members have their investments managed by the winning algorithms. Successful developer-members can get a royalty or commission from investor-members, who profit from the former's algorithm used with larger resources > $1M. Board member Andrew Parker claims that Quantopian is aiming for modest number of users and a large average revenue per user (ARPU); more like Bloomberg than Facebook.

Previously the company provided brokerage integrations to individual investors. These integrations were continued by the community who started the open source project Zipline-Live.In 2018, the company announced the availability of an enterprise software product for asset managers, in partnership with FactSet.

## Landscape:

To the average trader, Quantopian is a different type of online trading business. Simply put, Quantopian is the Uber of the investing industry. It matches algorithm developers with individual investors to create a mutually beneficial relationship.

This Boston-based company creates crowd-sourced hedge funds by recruiting freelance quantitative analysts to develop algorithms to trade securities. The algorithm developers can either back-test, use or sell their strategies. Or they can lend them to institutional investors for a cut in the equity. 

Developers can enter completed algorithmic strategies in the company-sponsored contest called the Quantopian Open. Winning algorithms are matched with institutional investors and the investor members pay successful developer members a commission on their equity. 

The open-source platform attracts algorithm developers and wannabes by creating a well-equipped workspace with major support. Quantopian promises that almost anyone can venture into quantitative finance with its tools, data and free education for beginners. 

Its primary competitors are other open source trading platforms, mainly Numerai, QuantConnect, & WorldQuant.

## Results

The company has funded individual algorithms with as much as $50,000,000. In February 2020 Quantopian announced it would return investors' money due to the underperformance of its investment strategies.

## Recommendations

The ease of use and quality of Zipline has enticed hedge fund researchers, investment managers, and trading desks to manage energy futures, cryptocurrencies, and U.S. and foreign equity markets without the high costs and high risk of building their own backtesting software. 

The popularity of Quantopian is demonstrated on GitHub, the leading community of open-source projects, where Zipline has received more than 5000 stars and 1700 forks. My recommendation for Quantopian is to improve their platform and encourage more people to work on their alpha which bring in Win Win for researchers and investors.
